    <h3>Automatically creates a strong passwords/PINs when logging into compatible servers.</h3>
</div>

## <a id="advantages"></a>Advantages

- ðŸ”’ Password synchronization uses the **Zero-Knowledge Encryption** technique. This means that the server you access will not know your passwords, since the entire encryption/decryption process is handled by the client.
- ðŸ–µ If you're recording, you **won't need to hide your screen** on the servers.
- ðŸ¤” Securely save your passwords/PINs without having to remember them.
- ðŸ”‘ All generated passwords/pins will be created using a combination of letters, numbers and special characters.
- ðŸŽ² All passwords generated use cryptographically secure generators.

## <a id="how-it-works"></a>How it works:

1. When entering a server, the addon will send a <a href="https://github.com/nickuc-com/nLogin-Addon/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/nickuc/login/addon/core/packet/outgoing/OutgoingHandshakePacket.java">OutgoingHandshakePacket</a> to the server.
2. If the server is compatible, it will reply with the <a href="https://github.com/nickuc-com/nLogin-Addon/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/nickuc/login/addon/core/packet/incoming/IncomingReadyPacket.java">IncomingReadyPacket</a> to the client.
3. **If the user is not registered:**
   1. The addon will create a secure password.
   2. The server's public key will be stored.
   3. All data will be saved to credentials.json file.
4. **If the user is registered:**
   1. The addon will search for a registered password and use it if available. 
   2. If the password is not found and the synchronization feature is enabled along with a linked account *(and an encryption password is optionally configured)*, the addon will attempt to decrypt the content stored remotely by the server using the <a href="https://github.com/nickuc-com/nLogin-Addon/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/nickuc/login/addon/core/handler/PacketHandler.java#L102">keys</a>.
